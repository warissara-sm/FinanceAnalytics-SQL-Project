üìä Finance Analytics ‚Äì SQL Project
üîé Overview

This project demonstrates Finance Analytics using SQL.
It simulates a banking dataset containing transactions, branches, and products, then applies data modeling (Star Schema), SQL-based KPI analysis, and prepares BI-ready views for visualization in Power BI or Tableau.

üìÇ Dataset Structure
‚≠ê Fact Table: transactions

TRANSACTION_DATE ‚Äì Transaction date

TRANSACTION_HOUR ‚Äì Hour of transaction

TRANSACTION_ID ‚Äì Unique transaction ID

CUSTOMER_ID ‚Äì Customer identifier

BRANCH ‚Äì Branch code

PROD_CODE ‚Äì Product code

UNITS ‚Äì Units sold / contracts signed

AMOUNT ‚Äì Transaction amount (Revenue / Loan amount / Fees)

üè¶ Dimension: branches

BRANCH ‚Äì Branch code

CHANNEL ‚Äì Distribution channel (e.g., Physical branch, Online)

REGION ‚Äì Region of branch

üì¶ Dimension: products

PROD_CODE ‚Äì Product code

PRODUCT_DIV ‚Äì Division of products

PRODUCT_GROUP ‚Äì Product group

PRODUCT_LINE ‚Äì Product line (e.g., Loan, Deposit, Insurance)

üìä Example Analytics (SQL)
1. Branch Revenue
SELECT REGION, CHANNEL, BRANCH,
       SUM(AMOUNT) AS total_revenue,
       SUM(UNITS)  AS total_units
FROM transactions t
JOIN branches b ON t.BRANCH = b.BRANCH
GROUP BY REGION, CHANNEL, BRANCH
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

2. Product Portfolio
SELECT PRODUCT_LINE, PRODUCT_GROUP,
       SUM(AMOUNT) AS total_revenue,
       SUM(UNITS)  AS total_units
FROM transactions t
JOIN products p ON t.PROD_CODE = p.PROD_CODE
GROUP BY PRODUCT_LINE, PRODUCT_GROUP
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

3. Customer RFM
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
           MAX(TRANSACTION_DATE) AS last_txn,
           COUNT(DISTINCT TRANSACTION_ID) AS frequency,
           SUM(AMOUNT) AS monetary
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY CUSTOMER_ID
)
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
       julianday('2008-01-01') - julianday(last_txn) AS recency_days,
       frequency, monetary
FROM customer_orders
ORDER BY monetary DESC;
